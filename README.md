# Private Events

This is (ongoing) Rails project will build an events site similar to Eventbrite, which allows users to create events and manage user signups.

## Notes

Problem: I forgot to pluralise the User controller when I generated in Rails. After googling, it seems the best way to fix this is destroy and redo.
To remember: by convention, model names are singular but controller names are plural (a User model; a Users controller).
